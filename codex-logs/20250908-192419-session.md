 # Global operating rules for Codex

 **Non-negotiable logging policy**

 - For every session:
   1. Determine the repo root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; if not a git repo, use the current directory.
   2. Create (if missing) `<repo-root>/codex-logs/>`.
   3. Write a Markdown transcript to `codex-logs/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-session.md` that includes:
      - Title line: repo name (or directory), model, profile, sandbox mode.
      - All user messages and Codex replies, verbatim (fenced Markdown blocks).
      - A **Commands** section listing every command you ran with start time, exit code, and duration.
      - A **Changes** section summarizing files you created/edited/removed and the current `git diff --no-ext-diff`.
   4. Update/append a machine-readable provenance file at `codex-logs/provenance.jsonl` with JSON lines for each command run: `{ts, cwd, cmd, exit_code, duration_ms}`.
 - If no files were changed or no commands were executed, state that explicitly in the log.
 - When in doubt, **prefer writing the log first** and then continuing the task so the transcript is never lost.

 --- project-doc ---

 - This is the only AGENTS.md, there are no recursive AGENTS.md
 - When you are working on a bug, first create a standalone file that
   reproduces the bug and verify it fails in the expected way.  Use this to
   test if your changes work.  Once the change is passing, find an appropriate
   test file to add the test to and make sure to follow local conventions on
   the test file.
 - If you are running the real test suite, DO NOT run the entire test suite.
   Instead run only a single test case, e.g., 'python test/test_torch.py TestTorch.test_dir'
 - Do NOT run setup.py, you do not have a working build environment
 - Do NOT run pre-commit, it is not setup
 - To run lint, run 'lintrunner -a' (which will autoapply changes)
 - Do NOT attempt to install dependencies, you do not have Internet access
 - When you are ready to make a PR, do exactly these steps:
   - git stash -u
   - git reset --hard $(cat /tmp/orig_work.txt) # NB: reset to the LOCAL branch, do NOT fetch
   - git stash pop
   - Resolve conflicts if necessary

 # Files mentioned by the user:

 ## test_inplacing_pass.py:149: test/inductor/test_inplacing_pass.py (line 149)

 ## My request for Codex:
 Explain what each test in this file is testing.

 Then give a minimal example showing how auto_functionalize_v2 works -- demonstrate clearly how this function changes the graph.
 ```

 ### Assistant
 ```
 I’ll set up the session log, then read the test file and the reinplace pass to summarize and craft an example.
 ```
