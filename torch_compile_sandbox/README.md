Torch Compile Sandbox
=====================

What this is
- A local, minimally hackable sandbox to inspect torch.compile’s Dynamo frontend and Inductor backend pipelines inside this checkout.
- Includes: pass-by-pass docs with file+line refs, and runnable scripts to dump graphs before/after key passes and at Inductor IR stages.

How to use
- Ensure you’re running against an environment with a working PyTorch install. These scripts import from this source tree for code refs, but execution uses your installed torch.
- From repo root, run: `python torch_compile_sandbox/scripts/<script>.py`.
- If you want artifacts (code, IR, graphs) on disk, set: `TORCH_LOGS=+dynamo,+bytecode,+inductor` and/or tweak options in each script.

Contents
- pipeline_dynamo.md — Dynamo pipeline and passes (order, IR, purpose, code refs).
- pipeline_inductor.md — Inductor pipeline: FX passes (pre/joint/post), lowering, scheduling, codegen (order, IR, purpose, code refs).
- examples.md — Small, relevant tests/examples in-tree with direct file:line pointers.
- scripts/
  - run_dynamo_bytecode_trace.py — Disassembles original vs. Dynamo-generated bytecode and dumps captured FX.
  - run_fx_pass_trace.py — Runs Inductor FX passes individually and prints before/after graphs.
  - run_inductor_ir_trace.py — Lowers to Inductor IR, shows pre/post fusion IR (scheduler) and emits code.

Notes
- Scripts default to simple demo functions; pass `--help` for options.
- If you don’t have a built-from-source torch, that’s OK: the scripts operate at Python layers (Dynamo/FX/Inductor Python IR) and should run with a standard PyTorch wheel.
